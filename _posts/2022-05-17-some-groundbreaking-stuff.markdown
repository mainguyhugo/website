You all are not going to believe it, but I've finally found a proof to Fermat's Last Theorem! (Also, I totally did that a little bit before Andrew Wiles, sorry my dude). It's actually really neat, and I was about to start writing it out, but I'm realizing that it doesn't fit in the margin of this code editor. Sorry guys! I promise it's actually not that hard though. I'll leave it as an exercise to the reader.
