Γειά! Χάρηκα πολύ!
You don't understand this? Me neither, it's all Greek to me.

Honestly, even the title of this page is hard to understand. It is hard to undertand things in general, or are there things that are hard to understand? What is the meaning of life? Why is the MS course numbered 5270 and the PhD one 6125, when clearly those two numbers have nothing in common? If the Greek word for perimeter did not start with π, would there instead be competitions to learn decimals of like, η? Or even ў if it was actually someone from Belarus who started drawing circles like there's no tomorrow (fun fact, you'd know because that specific letter is used pretty much only in Belarusian)? But also, it would feel pretty weird to have the word perimeter start with a totally different sound, right? My delicate ears could never. Anyway, it's been too long. But they are cool thoughts, so I'm going to copyright them.

Γειά! Still all Greek to me.
