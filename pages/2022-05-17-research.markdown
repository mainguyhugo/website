Here are some projects that I have worked on:

**Vehicle Routing Problems with Uncertainty**, with [Bruce Golden](https://www.rhsmith.umd.edu/directory/bruce-l-golden) and [Luca Bertazzi](https://luca-bertazzi.unibs.it/) (July 2023 - ):

The project is still in an early phase, but the overall aim is to find good algorithms and heuristics to solve different versions of the Vehicle Routing Problem before all inputs are actually known.

**Congestion Pricing in Bogotá**, with [Nikhil Garg](https://gargnikhil.com/), [Andrea Lodi](https://tech.cornell.edu/people/andrea-lodi/) and [Natthawut Boonsiriphatthanajaroen](https://www.orie.cornell.edu/research/grad-students/natthawut-boonsiriphatthanajaroen) (January 2022 - ):

Designing an optimal tolling system for the city of Bogotá, in partnership with Clearroad. This is an end-to-end project, using map matching with OpenStreetMap, designing alternate routes, creating a survey to determine users' willingness to pay given prices, and implementing a [graph algorithm](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10107-006-0076-2.pdf) in order to model the system (and more).

**PoliTech / Redistricting**, with [Robert Kelly](https://www3.cs.stonybrook.edu/~robkelly/index.htm), and research group (January 2020 - May 2021):

Designing a good redistricting system for US Congressional elections to fight against gerrymandering. Specifically, I focused most on compactness measures and their analysis.

<br/><br/>

**The Intersection of the Traveling Salesperson Cycle/Path with Other Graphs**, with [Joseph Mitchell](http://www.ams.sunysb.edu/~jsbm/jsbm.html), [Logan Graham](https://github.com/LoganDGraham), Gaurish Telang, [Sam van der Poel](https://samvanderpoel.github.io/) (January 2019 - May 2021):

Exploring the intersection of the TSP with various graphs such as the Nearest Neighbor Graph, Minimum Spanning Tree, Delaunay Triangulation/Diagram and more, proving among other things that the TSP path/cycle may be disjoint from the Nearest Neighbor Graph, and that there exist polygonalizations of a point set (a non optimal cycle) that can be disjoint from the Delaunay Triangulation.
