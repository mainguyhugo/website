Hello! My name is Hugo Mainguy, a third year PhD student in Operations Management at the University of Maryland Smith Business School. Prior to this, I obtained my MS in Operations Research and Information Engineering from Cornell University and my BS in Applied Mathematics and Statistics as well as Mathematics from Stony Brook University. I am broadly interested in modeling and heuristic/optimization for topics related to transportation and routing, such as Traveling Salesperson or Vehicle Routing problems, along with questions about societal systems, with some specifics being congestion pricing, redistricting, voting theory and more.

Updates September 2025: I passed my comprehensive exam, and will soon officially be a PhD candidate! I also resubmitted my paper with Bruce Golden and Luca Bertazzi, Estimating Optimal Solution Values for the 0-1 Knapsack Problem: An Introduction to Fortified Estimation.

Updates January 2025: Completed qualifying exams!

Updates September 2023: Started PhD in the Operations Management/Management Science in the Smith School of Business at the University of Maryland!
