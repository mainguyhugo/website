Hello! My name is Hugo Mainguy, a first year PhD student in Operations Management at the University of Maryland Smith Business School. Prior to this, I obtained my MS in Operations Research and Information Engineering from Cornell University and my BS in Applied Mathematics and Statistics as well as Mathematics from Stony Brook University. **I am not on the 2023-2024 academic job market, nor any of the preceding ones, in case someone was looking to fill a position that should have been filled a while ago.** I am broadly interested in topics related to transportation and routing, such as Traveling Salesperson or Vehicle Routing problems, along with questions about societal systems, with some specifics being congestion pricing, redistricting, voting theory and more.

Here's a nice picture of me from Imgur, because an anagram of Imgur is Mirug and my rug is really nice and a good host.

When I am not working, I am usually running from my problems or playing classical music on the piano. I am also known to have an incredible sense of humor (that's humour for the British translation), and also being very humble and modest.
