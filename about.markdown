Hello! My name is Hugo Mainguy, a first year PhD student in Cornell's Operations Research and Information Engineering department. **I am not on the 2021-2022 academic job market.** I am broadly interested in topics related to societal systems, with some specifics being congestion pricing, redistricting, voting theory and more.

Here's a nice picture of me from Imgur, because an anagram of Imgur is Mirug and my rug is really nice and a good host.

When I am not working, I am usually running or playing classical music on the piano. I am also known to have an incredible sense of humor (that's humour for the British translation), and also being very humble and modest.
